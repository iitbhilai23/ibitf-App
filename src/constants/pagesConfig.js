      "We have developed a prototype named Condition Coverage for Condition Coverage Analysis for Smart Contracts using Solidity Bounded Model Checker (CC-SolBMC). We demonstrate an approach for generating test cases to satisfy the condition coverage of smart contracts using a solidity-bounded model checker (an open source). We show the annotation of the original smart contract as per the condition coverage specification and drive the bounded model checker to prove the feasibility of the asserted properties. Finally, we collect all feasible targets and show the condition coverage score. Also, the proposed approach generates test input values for each feasible atomic condition. The approach presented has been tested with 70 real-time smart contracts available online, resulting in 57.14% of contracts with good condition coverage scores. CC-SolBMC certifies any smart contract to check whether Optimal or Maximum condition coverage is achieved. /n 2) Cyclo-Sol We have developed another product, the Cyclomatic Complexity Analyser of Solidity Smart Contract (Cyclo-Sol). As a first step, we propose using Control Flow Graph to measure the Cyclomatic Complexity of smart contracts. The motive of this product is to use the EthiIR* tool (an open source) to create a CFG from an Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract. We modified the tool for our purpose, i.e. to investigate Cyclomatic Complexity. Furthermore, we used our prototype tool to analyse various smart contracts and found a suitable outcome. /n 3) Smart-MuV erf /n We have developed another product named Mutatnt Verification for Smart Contract (Smart-MuVerf). The main objective of this work is to verify the created mutants for the smart contract. It is very important to test smart contract by looking at the critical business in the blockchain. If an incorrect contract or bug in the contract exists, then there is a high chance of losing the expensive assets. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to compute mutation score for a smart contract using a solidity compiler with a bounded model checker. We propose to use mutation verification in industry which replaces the traditional mutation testing methodology. /n 4) VeriSol-MCE /n We present a new tool to measure condition coverage criterion for smart contracts using Solidity-based model checkers. We demonstrate the process of annotating the original smart contract by the condition coverage properties and employ the model checker to validate the feasibility of the specified properties. Further, we assess the properties instrumented to compute the condition coverage score. We conducted experiments on 70 smart contracts, employing both the Bounded Model Checker (BMC) and Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC). Our findings demonstrate BMC’s superior performance compared to CHC. The tool we propose assists smart contract developers in verifying their code through condition coverage analysis. Utilizing both model checkers in tandem contributes to enhancing the quality of smart contracts, as the outcome may vary, and either of the checkers might yield superior condition coverage. /n Sol-Slicer /n CC-SolSym /n Smart contract verification is essential before deployment due to its immutability criteria. The condition coverage of a smart contract code refers to the accessibility of the blocks of code affected by any conditional statement, such as if-else, for loop, and while loop. Existing approaches for the verification of Smart Contracts are time-consuming, as the execution time increases with the number of variables. In this paper, we propose a program-slicing approach for fast and efficient conditional coverage analysis of Solidity Smart Contracts and tested with test cases generated by Model Checker Engines. We generate a Smart Contract Interconnection Map for the smart contract and slice the graph by considering each conditional statement as a seed. We introduce the notion of a slice sub-graph and slicing criteria to expand the slice region, covering the nodes that are reachable from the seed based on the dependencies. We also present algorithms for smart contract slicing. Our experimental results on 50 smart contracts demonstrate a significant reduction in the time required for conditional coverage analysis. The presented approach guarantees the reachability of every piece of code and detects dead code segments, thereby improving the confidence of the concerned parties in the Smart Contract. We propose a new technique to measure condition coverage criterion for smart contracts using a dynamic symbolic execution tool, i.e. Oyente. Typical execution may be a program examination which can be successfully utilised for the mechanised era of test inputs and for coordinating the finding of abandons in professional grams. The objective of typical execution is to execute those programs differently after standard execution for concrete inputs. We conducted experiments on 70 smart contracts using our developed Annotator with Oyente. Our finding shows that our tool performs better than Bounded Model Checker (BMC) and Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC) in covering condition edges. The tool we propose assists smart contract developers in verifying their code through condition coverage analysis. Using a combination of assertion annotation, symbolic execution, and post-analysis of assertion violations, it advances the security and reliability of smart contracts. Sol-Repairer The popularity of smart contracts has cemented their place in the Blockchain Ecosystem. This is because of the immense number of use cases smart contracts provide. They have become the go-to solution for improving transparency and security for all parties involved in the transaction. Furthermore, a smart contract is immutable after it is deployed. Thus optimization of the smart contract is very important before deployment. Sol-Repairer is a tool that provides the implementation for identifying dead code segments from solidity-written smart contracts and then repairing them. Ex-tensive experiments show that Sol-Repairer optimizes dead code better than the solidity compiler. The study also demonstrates that optimizing dead code reduces gas consumption significantly for smart contract.",

As the cloud is vulnerable and hence edge-based authentication is required. This method is native to the device without the need of the internet and the processing time within 20ms. We are in the process of prototyping it and collecting empirical data. This idea includes an AI pipeline with multiple AI models running in tandem. Next month we will fill the patent. 2.

      "Our proposed work is intended to develop an intelligent framework to manage scheduling and routing of heterogeneous vehicles that include EVs. The work is divided in two broad threads. In one thread we are developing the frontend of the tool through which users will interact. For this both web and mobile apps are planned. A preliminary version of these is ready. Mobile App for EV Owners: We are working on the development of a mobile app that can help EV owners obtain time-efficient routes. Based on the current battery charge, the app finds the routes that will take less time by considering factors such as the charging time, waiting time, and charging station availability. For this work, the initial prototype of the mobile app is prepared. Based on the current charge it can find the route the EV owner needs to follow. A web server handles the routing requests from multiple EV owners and updates the availability status of the charging station. Accordingly, if any EV owner finds that the nearby charging station is not available then an alternate route is searched that requires the least time to reach the destination considering the charging time. A Mongo DB is used to store the user trips, and charging details for each charging station. This data may be used for further analysis by the charging station to make an effective scheduling strategy when the cost factors are considered. On the other thread, for the backend, efficient algorithms are planned to be developed. Currently we are experimenting with a few algorithms. As it is well known that most of the vehicle routing problems are NP-Hard, we are exploring with meta-heuristic and heuristic methods. We will explore online versions of these to handle online scheduling and routing of vehicles.",
